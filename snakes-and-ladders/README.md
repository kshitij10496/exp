# snakes-and-ladders

This is a code companion to the YouTube video: [The Beautiful Math of Snakes and Ladders - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlm07asSU0c)

The notebook `game.ipynb` contains a solution to the Snakes-and-Ladders problem as presented in the video by Marcus du Sautoy. The solution is implemented in Python using the **SymPy** library as the computer algebra system. I have tried to implement a solution that can work for the general cases of square transitional matrices.

For the example snakes-and-ladders board from the video, I receive a value of **8.6** throws. Please note, the above value differs from the result in the video. I will dig deeper into the reason later.

In the future, I hope to read more about Markov chains and implement a solution using them directly. This should improve my understanding of the state transitions.
